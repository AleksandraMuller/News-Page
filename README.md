`PROJECT 2`

# Build your team yearbook

This week’s project is to create a yearbook-style image gallery of your team.
The code folder containers a starter html file, a css file and photos of your classmates.

It should include a photo of each student, their name and should look something like this design:

## Stretch Goals 🏃‍♂

Make sure you've commited and pushed a version of your project before starting with the stretch goals.

**_Design_**

- Play around with hover effects, i.e. change colors, add or remove borders or flip the image upside down.
- Add a box shadow to make the photos look like polariods
- Try to add some animations on your project

**_Deep-dive_**

- Align the cards to the center of the page
- Originally, all images came in different sizes and ratios. As a developer that's a pretty common situation, for instance when you fetch images from an API or CMS you don't necessarily know what the ratio will be - you just have to make it work! How would you have solved this assignment if this was the case? Here you can find the original photos try and solve the assigment again but with these photos instead.

**_Other solutions_**

- Did you create your project Mobile first? Great! that's the "modern way" of doing it. But, just to practise, try changing it to Desktop first. If you didn't write it Mobile first, do so 🙃
- Another soulution to dealing with a photo collection like this would be to use CSS-grid. [Check it out!](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)
