# Build a News Site ðŸ“º
In this project I created a classic magazine site. The site contains a header with a name of the site, a logo and a navbar. The header changes depending on if you visit the site from a mobile, tablet or desktop. Further the site have a big news section and a grid of cards with other news. On desktop sized screens, there are four cards in a row, two in a row on tablets and on mobile, there is just be one card on each row.

## In this project, you will find:
Website structured using boxmodel
Layout of website made using flexbox
Responsive webpage for mobile, desktop and tablet

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨
I have build a landing page of a magazine by the use of HTML and CSS. For layout I chose to use flexbox. I am proud of the responsiveness of the header section.
